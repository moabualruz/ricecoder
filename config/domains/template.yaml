# Domain Configuration Template
# 
# This template demonstrates all available configuration options for creating
# a new domain agent. Copy this file to create a new domain configuration.
#
# File Location: config/domains/{domain-name}.yaml
# Example: config/domains/mobile.yaml
#
# After creating a new domain configuration:
# 1. The system will auto-discover it from config/domains/ directory
# 2. Validate it against config/schemas/domain.schema.json
# 3. Create a domain agent instance automatically
# 4. Make it available for use without code changes
#
# For more information, see: projects/ricecoder.wiki/Custom-Domains.md

# ============================================================================
# SCHEMA VALIDATION
# ============================================================================
#
# This configuration is validated against config/schemas/domain.schema.json
# before being loaded. Validation ensures:
#
# ✓ All required fields are present
# ✓ Field types are correct (strings, arrays, etc.)
# ✓ Technology lists are non-empty
# ✓ No duplicate entries
# ✓ Required fields in nested objects are present
#
# If validation fails, the domain will not be loaded and an error message
# will be displayed indicating what needs to be fixed.

# ============================================================================
# EXAMPLES
# ============================================================================
#
# Example 1: Mobile Development Domain
# See: projects/ricecoder/config/domains/mobile.yaml
#
# Example 2: Data Science Domain
# See: projects/ricecoder/config/domains/data-science.yaml
#
# Example 3: Built-in Web Domain
# See: projects/ricecoder/config/domains/web.yaml

# ============================================================================
# HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE
# ============================================================================
#
# 1. Copy this file:
#    cp config/domains/template.yaml config/domains/my-domain.yaml
#
# 2. Edit the file with your domain information:
#    - Change "domain" to your domain identifier
#    - Update "name" and "description"
#    - Add your capabilities
#    - Add best practices for your domain
#    - Add technology recommendations
#
# 3. Validate your configuration:
#    The system will automatically validate when it loads
#
# 4. Restart or reload the system:
#    The new domain will be auto-discovered and available
#
# 5. Use your domain:
#    Request assistance for your domain and the agent will provide recommendations

# ============================================================================
# TROUBLESHOOTING
# ============================================================================
#
# Q: My domain is not being discovered
# A: Check that:
#    - File is in config/domains/ directory
#    - File has .yaml extension
#    - File is valid YAML syntax
#    - Domain field is present and non-empty
#
# Q: I get a validation error
# A: Check that:
#    - All required fields are present
#    - Technology lists are not empty
#    - Field types match the schema
#    - No duplicate technology names
#
# Q: Changes are not taking effect
# A: The system supports hot-reload:
#    - Save your changes to the YAML file
#    - The system will detect the change
#    - New requests will use the updated configuration
#    - Existing requests continue with old configuration
