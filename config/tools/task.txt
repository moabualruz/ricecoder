Launch a new agent to handle complex, multi-step tasks autonomously.

Usage notes:
1. Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible to maximize performance
2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you
3. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user - summarize it for them
4. Each agent invocation is stateless unless you provide a session_id
5. Your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description
6. The agent's outputs should generally be trusted
7. Clearly tell the agent whether to write code or just do research
