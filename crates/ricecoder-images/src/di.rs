//! Dependency injection support for ricecoder-images.
//!
//! This module provides factory functions for DI integration.
//! Note: Actual service registration is handled by ricecoder-di/src/services.rs
//! using feature flags to avoid circular dependencies.

// Factory functions can be added here as needed.
// Services.rs imports types directly from this crate's root module.
