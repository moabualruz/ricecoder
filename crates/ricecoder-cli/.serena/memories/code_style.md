Code style follows standard Rust conventions:

- Use snake_case for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for structs, enums, traits
- Async functions use tokio::main macro
- Error handling with Result types and early returns
- Use Path and PathBuf for file paths
- Comments for clarity, especially in main logic
- Modular structure with separate files for different features
- Use of dependency injection (DI) container
- Lifecycle management for components
