//! Integration tests for TEA pattern implementation
//!
//! This module tests the complete Model-Update-View cycle to ensure:
//! - State transitions are pure and deterministic
//! - Message handling produces correct state changes
//! - Commands are generated appropriately
//! - State consistency is maintained across operations
//!
//! NOTE: This test file is currently disabled due to incomplete implementation.
